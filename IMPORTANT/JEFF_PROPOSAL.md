## Proposal for the Re-evaluation and Removal of Jeff the Landshark from the Playable Roster of *Marvel Rivals*

**To:** The *Marvel Rivals* Development and Balancing Team
**From:** A Concerned Player and Advocate for Competitive Integrity
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Subject:** Analysis of Jeff the Landshark's Detrimental Impact on Thematic Cohesion and Competitive Balance

### 1.0 Executive Summary

This document presents a formal proposal to remove Jeff the Landshark from the core playable roster of *Marvel Rivals*. While acknowledging the character's charm and popularity in comic book fandom, his inclusion as a fully-fledged hero in a competitive, team-based PvP shooter introduces significant risks to the game's long-term health. The core arguments of this proposal center on three critical areas: irreparable thematic and tonal dissonance, fundamental challenges in creating a balanced and fair gameplay kit, and the potential erosion of the game's competitive integrity and esports viability. We recommend that Jeff's presence in the game be transitioned to a non-playable role, such as a cosmetic item or environmental feature, to preserve his delightful character without compromising the core gameplay experience.

### 2.0 Thematic and Tonal Dissonance

*Marvel Rivals* is positioned as a high-stakes, action-oriented hero shooter. The roster includes iconic powerhouses like Iron Man, cosmic entities like Galacta, and highly-trained combatants like Black Panther. While the Marvel universe is broad and contains humor, the context of *Rivals* is one of intense combat and strategic team play.

Jeff the Landshark, by his very nature, is a creature of pure whimsy. He is a small, adorable, non-humanoid animal whose appeal is rooted in his comedic, pet-like antics. Placing him on the battlefield alongside characters engaged in what is framed as serious conflict creates a jarring tonal clash. This dissonance undermines the game's narrative and aesthetic cohesion. When a player is eliminated not by a sophisticated energy blast or a masterfully executed martial arts combo, but by a cartoonish bite from a baby landshark, the competitive fantasy is broken. This trivializes the high-octane experience the rest of the roster so carefully builds.

### 3.0 Insurmountable Gameplay and Balancing Challenges

From a design and engineering perspective, integrating Jeff as a balanced playable character presents a near-impossible task without resorting to mechanics that would feel unfair or nonsensical.

*   **Hitbox and Target Acquisition:** Jeff's diminutive size and unique, low-to-the-ground profile create a fundamental problem for game balance. He would inherently be the most difficult character to target, especially for precision-based heroes. This is not a skill-based advantage, but a built-in frustration mechanic. To compensate, his health would have to be so low as to make him unviable, or his hitbox would need to be artificially inflated to a degree that no longer represents his visual model, breaking player immersion and trust in the game's physics.

*   **Kit Design and Logical Consistency:** What does a competitively viable kit for a landshark look like?
    *   **Primary Attack:** A bite? A tail whip? These attacks would have extremely short range, making him ineffective against a majority of the roster.
    *   **Abilities:** How does he interact with the game's core mechanics? Does he "swim" through the ground? This could function as an invulnerability or stealth frame, which is notoriously difficult to balance and often leads to player frustration (e.g., characters like The Wraith in *Apex Legends* or Sombra in *Overwatch* require constant tuning).
    *   **Verticality:** Maps in modern hero shooters are designed with verticality in mind. A character who is fundamentally bound to the ground plane is at an immediate, and likely insurmountable, disadvantage. Any mechanic designed to circumvent this (e.g., a "rocket jump" or a "sharknado" ultimate) would feel arbitrary and disconnected from the character's established identity.

The result is a character who is destined to be either a non-viable "troll pick" or a frustrating gimmick whose effectiveness is based on exploiting his flawed design rather than skillful play.

### 4.0 Erosion of Competitive Integrity and Esports Potential

For *Marvel Rivals* to succeed as a competitive title and a potential esport, the perception of legitimacy is paramount. The roster must be composed of characters that are seen as serious, strategic choices.

The inclusion of Jeff the Landshark directly threatens this legitimacy. He risks becoming a "meme character," whose selection in a ranked or professional match would be seen as a sign of disrespect to the opponent or a lack of serious intent. While this can be amusing in casual modes, it is toxic to a competitive ecosystem. The broadcast of a high-stakes tournament final could be undermined by the spectacle of a professional player being forced to engage with a cartoon shark, detracting from the display of skill and strategy that should be the focus.

### 5.0 Proposed Solution

We do not advocate for the complete removal of Jeff from the *Marvel Rivals* universe. His charm is undeniable, and he is a beloved character. We propose that his role be shifted from a playable hero to one of the following:

1.  **Cosmetic Integration:** Re-introduce Jeff as a universal weapon charm, a victory emote for related characters (e.g., Gwenpool, Deadpool), or a lobby pet that players can interact with between matches.
2.  **Environmental Element:** Place Jeff as a friendly, non-interactive NPC in a specific map location, similar to the cat in the Attacker's spawn on the *Overwatch* map "Paris."

These solutions allow the game to retain the character's charm and provide fan service without compromising the core tenets of fair, competitive, and thematically coherent gameplay.

### 6.0 Conclusion

The decision to remove Jeff the Landshark from the playable roster is not a rejection of the character, but an affirmation of the commitment to making *Marvel Rivals* a balanced, competitive, and enduring game. Thematic dissonance, fundamental design flaws, and the risk to competitive integrity present a compelling case for his removal. By transitioning him to a non-playable role, the development team can honor the character while protecting the long-term health and success of the game.
